\title{Export all data in a plpData object to CSV files}
\usage{
exportPlpDataToCsv(plpData, outputFolder)
}
\arguments{
\item{plpData}{An object of type \code{plpData}.}

\item{outputFolder}{The folder on the file system where the CSV files will be created. If the
folder does not yet exist it will be created.}
}
\description{
Export all data in a plpData object to CSV files
}
\details{
Created a set of CSV files in the output folder with all the data in the plplData object. This
function is intended to be used for research into prediction methods. The following files will be
created: \describe{ \item{cohort.csv}{Listing all persons and their prediction periods. This file
will have these fields: row_id (a unique ID per period), person_id, cohort_start_date, cohort_id,
time (number of days in the window).} \item{outcomes.csv}{Listing all outcomes per period. This
file will have these fields: row_id, outcome_id, outcome_count, time_to_event.}
\item{exclude.csv}{Either not exported or a file listing per outcome ID which windows had the
outcome prior to the window and should therefore be removed prior to fitting the model. This object
will have these fields: rowId, outcomeId.} \item{covariates.csv}{Listing the baseline covariates
per person in the cohorts. This is done using a sparse representation: covariates with a value of 0
are omitted to save space. The covariates file will have three columns: rowId, covariateId, and
covariateValue. } \item{covariateRef.csv}{A file describing the covariates that have been
extracted.} \item{metaData}{Some information on how the plpData object was constructed.} }
