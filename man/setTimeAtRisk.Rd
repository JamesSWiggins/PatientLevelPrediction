\arguments{
\item{includeAllOutcomes}{Do you want to include people who have the outcome but are not observed for the whole at risk period?}

\item{firstExposureOnly}{Only consider the first time occurence of the outcome?}

\item{washoutPeriod}{The minimum prior observation in days a person required to be included}

\item{removeSubjectsWithPriorOutcome}{Remove people who have the outcome some period before the time at risk?}

\item{priorOutcomeLookback}{The number of days prior to investigate for the variable removeSubjectsWithPriorOutcome}

\item{riskWindowStart}{The number of days after the at risk popualtion subject's index date to start the time at risk period}

\item{addExposureDaysToStart}{Should the risk window start be relative to the index end date instead?}

\item{riskWindowEnd}{The number of days after the at risk popualtion subject's index date to end the time at risk period}

\item{addExposureDaysToEnd}{Should the risk window end be relative to the index end date instead?}

\item{requireTimeAtRisk}{Should you only include people with a minimum time at risk period?}

\item{minTimeAtRisk}{If requireTimeAtRisk is TRUE, then this is the minimum number of days a person must be at risk}
